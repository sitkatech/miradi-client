A <i>resource</i> is a person or item that is needed to complete an activity/method or a task. There are three main kinds of resources:

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Human Resources:</strong> Members of your project team, other members of your 
organization, partners, advisors, consultants, or other people who can help accomplish tasks.  
Human resource units are usually measured in some time unit such as hours, days, weeks, or months. 
</li><br>
<li><strong>Material Resources:</strong> Items such as vehicles, boats, fuel, computers, offices,
 conference rooms, plane tickets, telephones.  Material resources are either measured in a time unit (days of boat rental) or as their own unit (numbers of round trip plane tickets).</li><br>
<li><strong>Financial Resources:</strong> The money required to pay for most human and material resources. Financial resources are usually figured in one or more standard currencies.

</ul>
