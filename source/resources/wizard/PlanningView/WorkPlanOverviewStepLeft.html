A <a href='Definition:WorkPlan' class='definition'>work plan</a> shows the specific 
<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a> 
/
<a href='Definition:Method' class='definition'>methods</a> 
and 
<a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a>
that you need to undertake to implement your strategic and monitoring plans.

<p>The workplan also enables you to develop a <a href='Definition:Budget' class='definition'>budget</a> for your project (in the future, it will also enable you to manage <a href='Definition:ActualExpenditures' class='definition'>actual&nbsp;expenditures</a>). The budget shows the costs and funding sources for the activities/methods and tasks that you need to undertake to implement your strategic and monitoring plans.</p>

<p> Miradi currently supports planning and budgeting by years or by 3-month <a href='Definition:Quarter' class='definition'>quarters</a>; it will eventually support other time frames. As a general rule, you should have a detailed work plan for the coming year and a rough plan for the years after that.</p>
