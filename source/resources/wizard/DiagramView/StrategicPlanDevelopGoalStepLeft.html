<a href='Definition:Goal' class='definition'>Goals</a> are linked to targets. If you used the basic method of viability analysis, then you will need to create your goals from scratch. If you used the Key Attribute method of viability analysis, you have already created specific sub-goals for your targets, but you will want to create a more general goal based on these specific ones.

<p>To create a new goal, double click on a target and then click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Goals&gt;</code> tab in the properties dialogue box. Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Goal&gt;</code> button at the side of the page. Fill in the following fields:</p>
			
<ul>
<li><p><strong>ID:</strong> A brief code used to identify and sort your goals and that will appear in the diagram. One common system is to assign the same letter given to a target, and then a number if there is more than one goal for this target (e.g., "A" or "D1").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Goal Name:</strong> The title of the goal. Generally 3-5 words (e.g., Maintain Seabird Populations)</p></li>
<li><strong>Goal Text:</strong> The complete goal statement that meets the criteria for a good goal.
<li><strong>Comments:</strong> Any additional comments about the goal.</li>
</ul> 

<br></br>If you want to use an existing goal from another target, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Clone Goal&gt;</code> button and follow the instructions.	To edit or delete a goal, click on the desired row and then either edit the text in the box at the bottom or click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Delete&nbsp;Goal&gt;</code> button.

<p>You can also view and edit all your project's goals using the <i>"Goals Only"</i> setting in the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Planning&nbsp;View&gt;</code>.</p>
