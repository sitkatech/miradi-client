<h3>Stresses</h3>
A <i>stress</i> is an impaired aspect of a conservation target that results directly or indirectly from human activities (e.g., low population size, reduced extent of forest system; reduced river flows; increased sedimentation; lowered groundwater table level).

<p> A stress is a degraded key ecological attribute - one that is outside its acceptable range of variation. Most of the stresses acting on your targets can thus be identified by looking at which key ecological attributes are currently degraded or have a high potential to become degraded within the planning horizon of your project (e.g., the next 10 years).</p></div>

<h3>Biophysical Factors</h3>
In some cases (e.g. to clarify all the effects of climate change), a project team may wish to show a string of ecological and/or physical factors that connect a direct threat to a conservation target. For example, as shown in the following figure, one of the key attributes of the River target is a certain flow regime. Reduced flows represent an altered KEA and, therefore, a stress to that target. Yet, this team found it useful to show the additional factors that show how fire and forest management practices caused this stress – in this case dense forests and soil moisture depletion. These latter two factors are not stresses (because they are not properties of the river system itself) but represent a key causal relationship in this model. We use the general term “biophysical factor” to represent any factor (including, but not limited to traditional stresses) that connect a direct threat to a conservation target.

<p class='hint'><strong>Warning:</strong> When using Biophysical Factors, do not “overgeneralize them” and use them to connect all threats to all targets. For example, if you create a factor of “habitat loss” and then connect it to all your targets, your threat rating tables will show all threats connected to all targets. Instead, you should create more specific biophysical factors such as “loss of stream habitat” and “loss of forest habitat.”</p>
