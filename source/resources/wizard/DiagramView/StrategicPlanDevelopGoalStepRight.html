A <i>goal</i> is a formal statement detailing a desired impact of a project. In conservation projects, it is the desired future status of a target. A good goal meets the criteria of being:
          
<ul>
<li><strong>Linked to Targets:</strong> Directly associated with one or more of your biodiversity targets</li>
<li><strong>Impact Oriented:</strong> Represents the desired future status of the target over the long-term</li> 
<li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Definable in relation to some standard scale (numbers, percentage, fractions, or all/nothing states)</li>
<li><strong>Time Limited:</strong> Achievable within a specific period of time, often 10 or more years</li>
<li><strong>Specific:</strong>Clearly defined so that all people involved in the project have the same understanding of what the terms in the goal mean</li>          
</ul>
