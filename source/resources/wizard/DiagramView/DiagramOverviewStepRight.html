<h3>Navigation Hints for the Diagram View</h3>

To <span class='task'>add a new target or other factor</span>, click the appropriate button on the control bar, use the drop down menu, or use the left mouse button. The new factor will appear on the page. To <span class='task'>select a factor</span>, single click on it. To <span class='task'>reposition a factor</span>, first select it and then use the mouse or arrow keys to move it wherever you like (if you are moving a big group of factors, use the mouse). The Move Factors Down and Right button can be used to </span>or <span class='task'> free up space</span> in the NW quadrant of the diagram.</p>

<p>Double clicking on a factor will bring up a dialog box in which you can <span class='task'>name the factor, add details, attach an indicator or objective to it, </span>or <span class='task'> type a comment</span>.</p>

<p>To <span class='task'>link factors</span> click on the first, hold the shift key, and then click on the second. Then click the arrow button to create the link. Or if you select a factor and then add a new factor, they will be automatically linked.</p>

<p>To <span class='task'>switch between conceptual models and results chains</span> use the tabs in the upper left and the page listings in the top of the control bar. The Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Zoom to Fit buttons can be used to <span class='task'>decrease or increase the size of the view</span>. The Control Bar can be used to <span class='task'>hide or show different types of factors</span> and to <span class='task'>manage page names</span>. The File/Export/PNG&nbsp;or&nbsp;JPEG Image menu commands can be used to <span class='task'>save a picture of your diagram</span> for use in other applications. The Tags feature can be used to <span class='task'>display a subset of the factors</span> in a diagram. Other more advanced tasks are described in subsequent wizard pages.</p>
