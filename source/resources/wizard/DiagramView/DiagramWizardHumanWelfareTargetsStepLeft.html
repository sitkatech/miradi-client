<p>If you want to use human wellbeing targets, you must first go to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Preferences/Project Settings&gt;</code> menu and change the mode from <i>"Default Mode"</i> to <i>"Human Wellbeing Target Mode."</i> You will now have the ability to enter brown Human Wellbeing scope boxes and tan colored human wellbeing targets.</p>

<p>Human wellbeing targets have all the same properties as conservation targets except that you cannot assign them a habitat classification or a species Latin name. They also do not factor into viability roll-up calculations.</p>
