The first step in building a conceptual model is to put your project <a href='Definition:Scope' class='definition'>scope</a> to one side (usually the far right) of your workspace.

<p>
To insert your scope, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert Scope Box&gt;</code> button in the Control Bar. Miradi will add a project scope box to your diagram. You can select and drag the scope box to wherever you want it to be. You can then double-click on the green Project Scope box to either review the scope you entered earlier or enter a new scope statement. </p>

<p class='hint'><strong>New Feature Hint:</strong> You can also have more than one scope box to depict more complex project situations. The scope box is <b>not</b> a Group Box - if you want to link to all items in your Scope Box you either must insert a Group Box into the Scope Box or link to all them individually.</p>
