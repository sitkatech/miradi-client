<h3>Two Methods for Viability Analysis</h3>
Miradi currently supports two modes for viability analysis.

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Simple Viability Analysis</STRONG> - This mode asks you to think about each target and to identify specific <STRONG>goals</STRONG> that outline the desired future condition of the target for your project.&nbsp;It then asks you to develop specific <STRONG>indicators</STRONG> that might be used to measure each goal.&nbsp;This mode is relatively simple and very flexible, but&nbsp;does&nbsp;not readily lend itself to&nbsp;systematic assessment of target viability.&nbsp;</LI><BR>
			  
<LI><STRONG>Key Attribute Viability Analysis</STRONG> - This mode asks you develop specific <STRONG>key ecological attributes (KEAs)</STRONG>&nbsp;for each target and specific <STRONG>indicators</STRONG> for each KEA.&nbsp;It then has you&nbsp;determine - to the best of your ability - an <STRONG>acceptable range of variation</STRONG> for each indicator, or in other words, to determine what a healthy target would look like.&nbsp;Finally, the method requires that you specify both the <STRONG>current status</STRONG> of each indicator as well as the <STRONG>desired&nbsp;future status</STRONG>. Collectively, the desired future status for all attributes become the <STRONG>goal</STRONG> for this target.&nbsp;This method is more systematic and enables comparisons across projects, but is more complex to design and implement.</LI>
</UL>

<P>It is important to note that both modes have the same ultimate outputs - the&nbsp;goal for each target and the&nbsp;indicator that will be used to assess progress towards this goal.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
