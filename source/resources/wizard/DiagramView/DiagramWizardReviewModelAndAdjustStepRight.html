<div class='navigation'>

Conceptual models should be considered dynamic. As you learn more about your project site, you should periodically revisit your conceptual model and revise it as necessary. You should also think about the interventions you have chosen and whether, based on the new information about your site, you need to choose new interventions or modify existing ones.

<p>Finally, a reminder - do not strive for perfection in your conceptual model. Strive for something that will be useful for your team - something that will help you portray what is happening at your site and determine what interventions you should be taking.</p>
