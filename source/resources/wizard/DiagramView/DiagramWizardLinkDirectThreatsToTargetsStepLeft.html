Many threats affect more than one target. To link your threat to another target, select the direct threat, hold the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Shift&gt;</code> key and then select the desired target. Then click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert&nbsp;Link&gt;</code> button (the arrow). You can also link direct threats to each other using the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert&nbsp;Link&gt;</code> button (the arrow).

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> The best way to link two factors in Miradi is to select the first one, hold the shift key, select the second one, and then click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert&nbsp;Link&gt;</code> button (the arrow) in the Control Bar. This method avoids the need to scroll through a lengthy list of all factors in the system.</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> If you end up with spaghetti - many crossing links - you can uncheck "target links" on the Control Bar to hide these links except when you click on a factor.</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> If you are using <a href='Definition:Stress' class='definition'>stresses</a>, you can position your stress boxes on a link between the threat and the target to display your stresses in the diagram. </p>
