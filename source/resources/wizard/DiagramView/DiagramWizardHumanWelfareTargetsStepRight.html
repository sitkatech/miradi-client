<h3>Using Human Welfare Targets</h3>
Some conservaton projects have not only conservation ends, but also have human welfare ends. Based on user requests, Miradi now supports <i>Human Welfare Targets</i>. Just as focal conservation targets represent the overall biodiversity values that a project is working towards, the human welfare targets can be used to represent the human welfare values for a project. Examples of human welfare targets might include:

<ul>
<li>Human population health,</li>
<li>Human food security,</li>
<li>Protection against flooding,</li>
<li>Recreation opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Miradi places no restrictions on how you choose to use human welfare targets. However, we <u>strongly recommend</u> that you do not mix conservation targets and human welfare targets in the same column as shown in Diagram A below. Instead, the recommended practice is to place the human welfare targets to the far right and then show the relationship between the human welfare and conservation targets as shown in Diagram B. In this example, the project team can show that human health (one component of human welfare) ultimately depends on having healthy species and habitat and clean abundant water. As a result, a pollution abatement strategy can be a conservation action - but also contributes to human welfare. But the project team can also decide and then show that they are not going to address all aspects of human health. For example, as shown in the diagram the team will not tackle smoking or fixing the health care system - these important tasks are the responsibility of other sectors of society.</p>
