<i>Direct threats</i> are primarily human activities that immediately affect a biodiversity target (unsustainable fishing, hunting, oil drilling, construction of roads, pollution or introduction of exotic invasive species).

<p>They can also, however, include natural phenomena altered by human activities (global warming caused by fossil fuel use) or natural phenomena whose impact is increased by other human activities (a tsunami that threatens the last remaining population of an Asian rhino).</p> 

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> It is important to distinguish between the direct threats that immediately affect biodiversity targets and the <a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>contributing factors</a> (also called indirect threats, opportunities, or root causes) that lead to the direct threats. In this step, you should only consider direct threats.</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> You may want to browse the <a href="http://conservationmeasures.org/CMP/IUCN/Site_Page.cfm">Classification of Direct Threats</a> for ideas of direct threats.</p>
