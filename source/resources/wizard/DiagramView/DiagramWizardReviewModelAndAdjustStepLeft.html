You have constructed your conceptual model in a series of separate steps. At this point, you should take a look at your model as a whole and ask yourself the following questions:

<ul>
<li>Does this model reasonably portray what is happening at my site?</li>
<li>Are all the key targets represented?</li>
<li>Are all the key direct threats represented?</li>
<li>Are all the key contributing factors (indirect threats and opportunities) represented?</li>
<li>Are the link arrows properly placed?</li>
<li>Is anything major missing?</li>
<li>Will the model be understandable to my project team?</li>
<li>Will the model be understandable to people outside of my project team?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you answered "yes" to all of these questions, <strong>Click the 'Next' button below to continue.</strong></p>

<p>If you answered "no" then you need to go back and fix your model.</p>
