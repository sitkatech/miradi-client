<h3>Navigation Hints for the Summary View and the Overall Application</h3>

<strong>Summary View</strong>

<br>The first few tabs in the Summary View contain basic information fields that most projects will want to fill in about their project, team, scope, location, and planning. This basic information will be especially important when you export your project to various reports and databases. Some organizations also have their own custom data fields for their projects. You can find these by clicking on the appropriate tab. 

<p><strong>Overall Application</strong></p>
All views have an interview pane on top and an action pane below. Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Previous&gt;</code> and <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Next&gt;</code> buttons to <strong>move backwards and forward</strong> through the interview. <strong>You can resize or hide the interview pane</strong> by using the splitter and/or arrows. In many dialog boxes, you can use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Instructions&gt;</code> button at the bottom left to <strong> go the appropriate interview page.</strong> You can also often use the right (alt) mouse button to get context sensitive menu commands (Mac users with one button mice can hold the button for several seconds). Use the buttons on the upper right to get context sensitive 
<strong>additional information, examples</strong>, and <strong>workshop hints</strong>.</p>

<p>
Note that the program automatically saves all changes so there is no &quot;save&quot; command.  You can save a copy under a different name using the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Save&nbsp;As&gt;</code> menu command.</p>
