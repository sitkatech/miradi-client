A project's <i>scope</i> is the broad focus of the project. Projects focused on the biodiversity of a specific place have a geographic scope (project area), such as a national park or tribal fishing grounds. In some cases, you may need to define your biodiversity targets before coming to a final decision about the geographic boundaries of your project. If you are working in a watershed, for example, you may be interested in conserving a forested area that stretches from 
your watershed into a neighboring basin. In this case, the definition of your targets would cause you to extend the geographic boundaries of your project scope.

<p>Other projects have a thematic scope, with a focus on a population of wide ranging animals, such as migratory birds, mammals or sea turtles, or a focus on certain ecological systems, such as forests, or issues such as illegal trade of rare and endangered species or poverty.</p>

<p>If there is any doubt about the basic scope of your project, then discuss the options with the members of your project team and see if you have at least a general consensus. If you can't arrive at some basic consensus, then you need to seriously reconsider whether you should split into multiple projects.</p>
