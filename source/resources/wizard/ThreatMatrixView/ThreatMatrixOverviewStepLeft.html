<h3>Welcome to the Threat Rating View</h3>

Miradi's default method is the Simple Threat Rating Mode (see description of the two modes in the right wizard panel). If you want to use the Stress Based Threat Rating Mode, you can select it using the drop down in the threat rating view toolbar, or the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Preferences/Threat Rating View&gt;</code> menu and change the <strong>Threat Rating Mode</strong> field to <i>"Stress Based Threat Rating Mode."</i>

<p>The table below contains a summary of your threat ratings. Target-Threat combinations that have been rated should appear colored in. If there is a threat or target that is missing or a threat is not linked to a specific target, return to the <a href='View:Diagram'>diagram view</a> to add the factors or links and then return to this view to rate them.</p> 

<p><strong>Click next to continue with the threat rating process.</strong></p>
