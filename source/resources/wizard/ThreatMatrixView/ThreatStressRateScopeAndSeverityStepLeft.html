Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Manage Stresses&gt;</code> button. You should see a list of all stresses that you previously identified as affecting this target (you can also create, edit, and delete stresses as needed from this table).

<p>Using the definitions in the right hand wizard panel and the drop down menus, rate the <i>scope</i> and the <i>severity</i> of each stress on the target. Note that at this point, you should be doing the ratings for the impact of the stress on the target regardless of which direct threats (sources of stress) are contributing to this stress. Miradi will then calculate the Summary Rating for each stress on this target. </p><p>When you have rated all of the stresses, click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Close&gt;</code> button to return to the threat rating table.</p>
