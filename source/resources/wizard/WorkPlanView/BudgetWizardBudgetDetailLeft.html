At this point, you should have already developed your basic work plan showing <a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a>/<a href='Definition:Method'  class='definition'>methods</a> and <a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a> and assigning <a href='Definition:Resource' class='definition'>resources</a> to each.

<p>To add budget detail to an activity/method or task, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work&nbsp;Plan&gt;</code> radio button in the Planning View and select the item that you want to focus on. You should already see the number of units for each quarter for that resource. Using the drop down menu, you can then assign an <a href='Definition:AccountingCodes' class='definition'>accounting code</a> and <a href='Definition:FundingSources' class='definition'>funding source</a> for that resource.</p>

<p>If you have already added the cost per unit for a resource, at this point you should see the total cost for that resource for the year (if planning by years) or for the quarter and rolled up for the year (if planning by quarters). The annual amount is then displayed in the table at the top of the page. Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Resources&gt;</code> tab and select the resource in the table if you need to edit the cost per unit information.</p>
