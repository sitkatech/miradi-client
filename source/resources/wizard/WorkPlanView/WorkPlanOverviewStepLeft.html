<h3>Welcome to the Work Plan View - Allocating a Team’s “Time and Treasure”</h3>
A <a href='Definition:WorkPlan' class='definition'>work plan</a> shows the specific 
<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a> 
and 
<a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a>
that you need to undertake to implement your action and monitoring plans.

<p>
The work plan view also enables you to develop a forward looking budget for your project.
The budget shows the planned costs for the strategies, activities and tasks
that you need to undertake to implement your action and monitoring
plans. 
</p>

<p>Work planning assumes that the most valuable resource that a project has is the time of its team members, 
but that a team also has to track other costs as part of their project budget. 
It also assumes that a project team will want to start with high-level planning for the life of the project 
and then add more detailed planning in the short-term.
