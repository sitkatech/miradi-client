<i>Actual expenditures</i> are backwards looking reports on the money you spent for the activities/methods and tasks you undertook to implement your strategic and monitoring plans.  They typically can be organized in several ways:

<ul>
<li><strong>By Accounting Code -</strong> Reports of money spent in each accounting code category.  These are useful for reporting to your organization's accounting department and to donors.</li>          
<li><strong>By Activity -</strong> Reports of money spent by activity, strategy, objective, and/or goal.  This is the basis for Activity Based Costing (ABC) and is essential to improve management effectiveness.</li> 
<li><strong>By Funding Source -</strong> Reports of money spent by each funding source.  These are useful for managing your cash-flow and for reporting to donors.</li>          
<li><strong>Against Budgets -</strong> Reports of money spent against the projections in your budgets. These are useful for managing your cash-flow and for improving your forecasting ability over time.</li>
</ul>
