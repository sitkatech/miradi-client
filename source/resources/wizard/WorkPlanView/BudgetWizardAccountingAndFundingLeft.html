To develop a budget, you will first want to create <a href='Definition:AccountingCodes' class='definition'>accounting codes</a> and <a href='Definition:FundingSources' class='definition'>funding sources</a>.

<p>In the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Accounting&nbsp;Codes&gt;</code> tab at the top of the Planning View, if your project already has accounting codes from your home organization, you can use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Import&nbsp;Accounting&nbsp;Codes&gt;</code> button to import a <a href='Definition:TabDelimitedFile' class='definition'>tab delimited text file</a> (2 columns, code followed by description). If you have to create codes from scratch, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Accounting&nbsp;Code&gt;</code> button to add a new one and then type the code and the label in the box at the bottom of the page. Repeat for other codes as needed.</p>
			
<p>On the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Funding&nbsp;Sources&gt;</code> tab at the top of the Planning View, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Funding&nbsp;Source&gt;</code> button to add a new one and then type the code (if needed) and the label in the box at the bottom of the page. Repeat for other funding sources as needed.</p>
