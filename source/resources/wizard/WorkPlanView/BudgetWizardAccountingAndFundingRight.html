<i>Accounting codes</i> are a set of categories developed by an organization to categorize and track expenses. They typically include hierarchical strings of numbers and/or letters (the code) along with a text description.  For example:

<p><strong>200.000 Core Salaries</strong><br></br>
201.000  Directors' salaries<br></br>
202.000  Staff salaries<br></br>
</p>          
			
<p>Information that is tracked through the use of accounting codes can include:</p>          
			
<ul>
<li><strong>Expense Type -</strong> Salary, travel, equipment, etc. This information is often used to help prepare reports to donors and/or tax returns.</li> 
<li><strong>Department -</strong> The branch of the organization that is incurring the expense.</li>          
<li><strong>Funding Source -</strong> Some organizations also use their codes to specify the specific funding source (although Miradi also treats this separately).</li>          
<li><strong>Other Information -</strong> Categories that the organization wants to track.</li>          
</ul>
          
<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> It is likely that your home organization will already have a chart of accounts that they will want you to use.</p>
          
<p>Funding sources are, as the name implies, the sources of money available to your project.  They are typically divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restricted sources -</strong> Funds such as a grant from a donor that are dedicated to a specific project or set of activities.</li>          
<li><strong>Unrestricted sources -</strong> Funds that can be used in any way the project chooses.</li>          
</ul>
