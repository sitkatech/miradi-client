For Simple viability analysis, double click on the target that you want to work on and make sure the Viability Analysis Mode field is set to "Key Attribute". Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Viability&gt;</code> tab.

<p>Next, use the drop down box in the <strong>Target Viability Status</strong> field to assign a status rating for the target. This rating will appear at the top of the properties dialog, and will be displayed in the diagram as a small oval next to the target. You should also fill out the <strong>Current Status Justification</strong> field with any information about how you arrived at this rating.

<p>
Goals and indicators for this target will be identified and added later.
