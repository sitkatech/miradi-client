The next step is to develop&nbsp;<a href='Definition:ViabilityRatings' class='definition'>viability ratings</a> for each indicator.

<P>For a selected indicator, type in the <b>value range</b> field for the "good" rating what you think the minimum <a href='Definition:AcceptableRangeofVariation' class='definition'> acceptable range of variation</a> might be for that indicator.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can then also specify what might be in the "fair" value range.&nbsp;These ratings will then appear in the table at the top in the appropriate column.</p>

<p>For example, a project team might say that&nbsp;an indicator for a grassland target is the presence of regular fire events.&nbsp;They might lay out an initial estimate as follows:</P>

<P>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> Developing indicator ratings is an adaptive process.&nbsp;You should not expect to immediately&nbsp;specify highly quantitative and precise thresholds.&nbsp;Instead, in your first pass through the table, you may only have qualitative assessments. Click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Example&gt;</code> button to see in greater detail how this adaptive process develops over time.</P>
