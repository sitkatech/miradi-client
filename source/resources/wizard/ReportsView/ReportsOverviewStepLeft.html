<h3>Welcome to the Reports View</h3>

This view enables you to produce various reports about your project. As described in the right hand panel, reports are only one of many ways to export your information from Miradi to other applications.

<p>Miradi currently supports three types of reports:

<ul>
<li><b>Standard Reports - </b>See Miradi Share for standard report templates.</li><br>
<li><b>Report Templates - </b>This tab allows you to generate your own reports that produce documents in accordance with your specific needs. Any Custom Tables that you have created in Planning View will be available for selection in a Custom Report.  Miradi currently only supports the ability to include entire sections of your project plan; future versions will allow much more granular control over specific fields for inclusion in a custom report.</li><br> 
<li><b>XSL Templates - </b>This tab allows advanced users to create custom reports using external XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) templates following the XMPZ2 schema.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you select one of the non-XSL reports, Miradi will prompt you to save the report as a Rich Text Format (RTF) file. Once you have created this file, you can then further edit it using a Word Processor program such as MS Word or Open Office. In particular, you can make use of paragraph styles (each item such as Objectives or activities has its own style) as well as table formatting commands (e.g., Distribute Columns Evenly or Auto Row Height) to quickly develop a formatted table.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you create a RTF file, it is best to re-save it as a Word .doc or other native word processor file - if you re-save it as a RTF file after editing, the file size can get very large.</p>
<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you edit the report in your word processor, the next time you generate a report, those changes will not be maintained and you will have to edit the output again.</p>
