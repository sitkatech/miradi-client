<h3>Welcome to the Reports View</h3>

This view enables you to produce various reports about your project. As described in the right hand panel, reports are only one of many ways to export your information from Miradi to other applications.

<p>Miradi currently supports two types of reports:

<ul>
<li><b>Standard Reports - </b>This tab allows you to generate pre-defined reports that produce documents in accordance with the CMP Open Standards. Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Full&nbsp;Report&gt;</code> button to create a document showing all of your project info; use the remaining buttons to create a document showing one section of your plan.</li><br>
<li><b>Custom Reports - </b>This tab allows you to generate your own reports that produce documents in accordance with your specific needs. Miradi 2.2 only supports the ability to include entire sections of your project plan; future versions will allow much more granular control over specific fields for inclusion in a custom report. Contact us at <A href="mailto:support@miradi.org">support@miradi.org</A> if you would like to develop your own custom report.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you select one of the reports, Miradi will prompt you to save the report as a Rich Text Format (RTF) file. Once you have created this file, you can then further edit it using a Word Processor program such as MS Word or Open Office. In particular, you can make use of paragraph styles (each item such as Objectives or activities has its own style) as well as table formatting commands (e.g., Distribute Columns Evenly or Auto Row Height) to quickly develop a formatted table.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you edit the report in your word processor, your changes will not be maintained the next time you generate a report. As a result, try to make the edits in the appropriate Miradi fields where possible.<p>
