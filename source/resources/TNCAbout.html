<h3>About The Nature Conservancy (TNC)</h3>

The Nature Conservancy's mission is to preserve the plants, animals and natural communities that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive.
 
<p>Since 1951, TNC has protected more than 117 million acres of land and 5,000 miles of rivers and operates more than 100 marine conservation projects globally.</p> 
 
<p>TNC uses the Conservation Action Planning (CAP) process to guide its project level work.  CAP provides an objective, consistent and transparent accounting of conservation actions and the intended and actual outcomes of conservation projects. It enables project staff to responsively adapt their actions to improve strategy effectiveness and to achieve greater conservation impact by sharing lessons learned across projects.  For more information on CAP, visit <a href='http://www.conservationgateway.org/cap'>www.conservationgateway.org/cap</a>.</p>
