<h1>2. Plan your actions and monitoring</h1>
<p>Once you have described the basic parameters for your project, the next step is to design the
specific strategies you will undertake to achieve conservation. In particular, this step
involves developing your <strong>Action Plan</strong> that you will use to record your 
project's <strong>goals</strong>,
<strong>strategies</strong>, and <strong>objectives</strong>. It also includes developing 
the <strong>Monitoring Plan</strong> that you will use
to track your progress and developing your <strong>Operational Plan</strong> that will specify the resources
you need and risks you should consider. Finally, it involves compiling all your work from
Steps 1 (Conceptualize) and 2 (Plan) into your <strong>Strategic Plan</strong>.</p>
