<h1>2C. Develop an operational plan</h1>
<p>Conservation projects are ultimately implemented by people and institutions. Even the best
action and monitoring plans are useless unless you make sure you can actually put them into
operation. In other words, you need an Operational Plan for your project. Key components
for an operational plan include analyses of:</p>
<ul><li>Funding required to implement your project, and your current and potential sources of
these funds</li>
<li>Human capacity and skills and other non-financial resources required to implement
your project and what you need to do to develop those resources</li>
<li>What risk factors exist for your project and how they can be addressed.</li>
<li>How long your project will last, how you will ensure the sustainability of your project’s
achievements, and what your exit strategy will be.</li></ul>
<p>The level of detail and formality of your operational plan will vary depending on the size and
level of complexity of your project. Small projects may only briefly touch on each of these
topics whereas large, complex ones might have an extensive and formal treatment of each.</p>
Outputs for this standard practice include an operational plan that contains:
<ul><li>Assessment of human, financial, and other resources.</li>
<li>Risk assessment and mitigation.</li>
<li>Estimate of lifespan and exit strategy.</li></ul>
<p>In addition, at the conclusion of Step 2, you should compile the work you did in Steps 1 and 2
into your overall Strategic Plan.  The output here is:</p>
<ul><li>Your overall Strategic Plan.</li></ul>
