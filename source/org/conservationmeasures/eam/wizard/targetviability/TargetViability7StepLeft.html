<P>The&nbsp;next step is to determine the 
			<U>current status</U>&nbsp;for each indicator</FONT>.</P>
			<P>For a selected indicator, fill in the 
			following fields:</P>
			
			<ul>
			<LI><STRONG>CS Rating:&nbsp;</STRONG>&nbsp;What rating category your indicator is 
			currently at. 
			<LI><STRONG>CS Date:</STRONG>&nbsp;The date of 
			the&nbsp;most recent indicator measurement. 
			<LI><STRONG>CS Label:</STRONG>&nbsp;Brief 
			description of the current&nbsp;value of the indicator or other short 
			descriptor. 
			<LI><STRONG>CS Text:</STRONG>&nbsp;Full 
			description of the current value of the indicator. 
			<LI><STRONG>Confidence:</STRONG>&nbsp; Your 
			confidence rating&nbsp;in the source of the indicator measurement. 
			<LI><STRONG>Trend:</STRONG> Your assessment 
			of the direction that this indicator is heading. 
			</ul>
			
			<P>Miradi will automatically shade in the 
			cell of the indicator ratings table with the color corresponding to your current 
			status assessment.&nbsp;It will also display an arrow showing the trend, and the 
			current status label.</P>
			<p>
			The rating for this indicator will also appear on the appropriate row in the 
			upper panel. Miradi will calculate a status rating for each KEA, based on the ratings 
			of its indicators. The KEA ratings will be rolled up for each KEA type, and the 
			average of the KEA type status ratings will be used as the viability status rating for the 
			target. 
			This target viability status rating will appear at the top of the properties dialog, and 
			will be displayed in the diagram as a small ellipse next to the target.
