The first step in the project cycle involves specifying who will be on the

</p>
<p>
To develop your team, click on the

button and fill in the appropriate fields. Miradi treats team members as human resources for the project. Fields include:<li>
<strong>Resource ID</strong> - 
The team members initials or an abbreviation for their position.</li><li>
<strong>Resource</strong> - The name of the team member.</li><li>
<strong>Roles</strong> - 
The roles that the person plays on the team.</li><li>
<strong>Organization / Position / Phone / Email</strong> - Information about the team member.</li><li>
<strong>Unit(s) / Cost Per Unit</strong> - 
Salary or other payment information about the team member.</li></ul>
Click the
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Close&gt;</code> 
button when you are finished.  Add other team members as necessary.
</p><p>Note that team members often include people from other organizations. In some cases, team members/human resources are not just one person, but rather a sub-team or class of indivdiuals - for example, a biological monitoring team.
