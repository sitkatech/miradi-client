An <strong>indicator</strong> is a measurable entity related to a specific information need, such as the status of a target, 
change in a threat, or progress towards an objective.  Indicators can be quantitative measures or qualitative 
observations. Good indicators meet the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Measurable: </strong>
Able to be recorded and analyzed in quantitative or in discreet qualitative terms.


<li>
<strong>Clear: </strong>
Presented or described in such a way that its meaning will be the same to all people.  


<li>
<strong>Sensitive: </strong>
Changing proportionately in response to actual changes in the condition or item being measured. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Indicators can be assigned different priorities as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Very High: </strong>
Must be monitored.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>High: </strong>
High priority for monitoring.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Medium: </strong>
Monitor only if resources allow.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Low: </strong>
Not necessary to monitor.  
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can record the current status of monitoring for each indicator as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fully on Schedule: </strong>
Monitoring going as planned or better.</li>
<li>
<strong>Going Well: </strong>
Monitoring generally progressing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Problems Implementing: </strong>
Monitoring encountering some challenges.

</li>
<li>
<strong>Not Started: </strong>

</li>
