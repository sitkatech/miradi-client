				Once you have isolated the chain that you want to work on, 
				brainstorm draft <a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategies</a> that your team could use at 
				various points along the chain.  Select the factor and 
				click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert Draft Strategy&gt;</code> button on the toolbar or legend.
