<a href='Definition:DirectThreat' class='definition'>Direct threats</a> 
are primarily human activities that immediately 
affect a biodiversity target (unsustainable fishing, hunting, 
oil drilling, construction of roads, pollution or introduction 
of exotic invasive species).
</p>
<p>
They can also, however, include natural phenomena altered by 
human activities (global warming caused by fossil fuel use) 
or natural phenomena whose impact is increased by other human 
activities (a tsunami that threatens the last remaining population 
of an Asian rhino).
</p> 
<p>
<strong>Hint: </strong> It is important to distinguish between 
the direct threats that immediately affect biodiversity targets 
and the 
<a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>contributing factors</a> 
(also called indirect threats, opportunities, or root causes) that lead to 
the direct threats. In this step, you should only consider direct threats.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hint: </strong>	You may want to browse the 
<a href="http://conservationmeasures.org/CMP/IUCN/Site_Page.cfm">Classification of Direct Threats</a> 
for ideas of direct threats.
