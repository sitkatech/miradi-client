Although for some direct threats there may be only one contributing factor, for 
others, there may be many. The idea is to construct 
<a href='Definition:Chain' class='definition'>chains</a> 
 showing the sequence 
of indirect threats and opportunities affecting your threats.
</p>
<p>
You can add additional factors to the chain by using the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert Contributing Factor&gt;</code>
button. You can add additional links by selecting 
one factor, holding the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Shift&gt;</code>
 key, selecting the second factor, and then 
clicking on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code>
button (the arrow).
</p>
<p>
You can also highlight a chain by selecting a direct threat factor, 
right-clicking the mouse, and picking the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Select Factor Chain&gt;</code>
command.
