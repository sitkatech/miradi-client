<h3>Navigation Hints for the Diagram View</h3>

To <span class='task'>add a new target or other factor</span>, click the appropriate button on the control bar, use the drop down menu, or use the left mouse button. The new factor will appear on the page. To <span class='task'>select a factor</span>, single click on it. To <span class='task'>reposition a factor</span>, first select it and then use the mouse or arrow keys to move it wherever you like (if you are moving a big group of factors, use the mouse).</p>

<p>Double clicking on a factor will bring up a dialog box in which you can <span class='task'>name the factor, add details, attach an indicator or objective to it, </span>or <span class='task'> type a comment</span>.</p>

<p>To <span class='task'>link factors</span> click on the first, hold the shift key, and then click on the second. Then click the arrow button to create the link. Or if you select a factor and then add a new factor, they will be automatically linked.</p>

<p>To <span class='task'>switch between conceptual models and results chains</span> use the tabs in the upper left and the page listings in the top of the control bar. The zoom-in and zoom-out buttons can be used to <span class='task'>decrease or increase the size of the view</span>. The Control Bar can be used to <span class='task'>hide or show different types of factors</span> and to <span class='task'>manage page names</span>. The File/Export/PNG&nbsp;or&nbsp;JPEG Image menu commands can be used to save a picture of your diagram for use in other applications. Other more advanced tasks are described in subsequent wizard pages.</p>
