A good results chain should meet the following criteria:
          	
<ul>
<li><strong>Results Oriented:</strong> Boxes contain desired results (e.g., reduction of hunting), and not activities (e.g., conduct a study).</li>
<li><strong>Causally Linked:</strong> There are clear "if...then" connections between successive boxes.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrates Change:</strong> Each box describes how you hope the relevant factor will change (e.g., improve, increase, or decrease).</li>
<li><strong>Reasonably Complete:</strong> There are sufficient boxes to construct logical connections but not so many that the chain becomes overly complex.</li>
<li><strong>Simple:</strong> There is only one result per box<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
