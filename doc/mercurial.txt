Windows users:

- Download and install putty
- Request ssh access on benetech04
- Request that you be added to the miradi group on benetech04
- Get Jake/Ron to help you get putty working with a keypair
- Download and install mercurial
- Add mercurial to the path
- Create mercurial.ini in the mercurial program directory, if it doesn't exist
- Add the following to mercurial.ini:
  [ui]
  ssh="path-to\plink.exe" -ssh -l yourusername -i "path-to\private-key.ppk"
  username=First Last <email@address>
  (where path-to, yourusername, private-key and First Last are your values)
- Verify by running "hg showconfig". There should be a ui.ssh entry.
(Skip to common section below)

Linux users:
- Install ssh and create a private key
- Request ssh access on benetech04
- Request that you be added to the miradi group on benetech04
- Make sure you can ssh to benetech04
- Install mercurial, ideally via normal distro repository (apt, rpm)
- Add the following to ~/.hgrc (create it if it doesn't exist)
  [ui]
  username=First Last <email@address>
  (where path-to, yourusername, private-key and First Last are your values)
(Skip to common section below)

Mac users:
- Request ssh access on benetech04
- Request that you be added to the miradi group on benetech04
- Make sure you can ssh to benetech04
- Download and install mercurial
- Add the following to ~/.hgrc (create it if it doesn't exist)
  [ui]
  username=First Last <email@address>
  (where path-to, yourusername, private-key and First Last are your values)
(Skip to common section below)


Common section:
- On the server, in your home directory, create a file named .hgrc with:
  [trusted]
  groups=miradi
  
  (NOTE: this is case-sensitive)
- Create a new miradi-hg directory, and try:
  hg clone -v ssh://subversion.benetech.org//opt/hg/Miradi/miradi
- You should start to see output like:
  destination directory: miradi
  requesting all changes
  adding changesets
- It should take about 10 minutes to get to "adding file changes"
- After another 10-20 minutes, you should be back to command prompt
- This will have created a miradi directory inside miradi-hg
- Install the MercurialEclipse plugin: 
  http://javaforge.com/project/HGE#download
- In eclipse, create a new workspace in your miradi-hg directory
- Windows users only: Window/Prefs/Team/Mercurial: browse so the 
  mercurial command is the one you installed earlier 
- Create a new Java project, named miradi. 
  It should adopt the existing project and 
  should automatically associate it with mercurial
- If you get an error when pushing due to multiple heads:
  1. Cancel the push
  2. Switch to Java perspective
  3. Select the top-level miradi project in the package tree
  4. If that did not work, do Right-click/Team/Merge...
  5. You should see an entry in the list above the bold item.
     Select it, and say merge/ok
  6. If there are conflicts, you will have to resolve them, 
     similar to how was done in svn
  7. When there are no conflicts, a merge commit dialog will come up
  8. Accept the default commit description and hit ok
  9. Now push your changesets, including this new merge commit
  
(Need to experiment more with rebase to see if it can safely avoid 
some/many merges).
